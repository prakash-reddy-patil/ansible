# The register keyword is used to capture the output (result) of a task and store it in a variable

# shell vs command 
# ---------------------------------------
# Remote login: take login, execute command, and come out, or log in inside the server and execute the command.
# When we don't have readymade modules available, we can execute a command or shell module. 
# command module -> a simple command with no need of access to shell environment-like variables, bash, piping,etc .
# shell module -> can access variables, pipes, redirections, shell, environment, etc.
